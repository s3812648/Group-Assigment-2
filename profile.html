        <h2>IDEAL JOB</h2>
        <h3>
            Data Analyst vs AI Developer vs Game Developer
        </h3>
        <p>
            The most obvious common ground for these 3 Jobs is their familiarity with AI technology. 
            Wherein Data Analysts and AI developers build, iterate upon, and improve machine learning models and algorithms, Game developers implement AIs into their games 
            (This is done regardless of game genre and studio) 
            to automate many gameplay elements and features, or in “NPCs”. 
            Another similarity, albeit less apparent, is how all three of these occupations work alongside/with data – 
            Game development hinges on player-driven data, with most triple A (AAA) studios building games according to market statistics 
            (Sales of games based on genre, feature, business models, etc.…) 
            and online games being updated based on gameplay stats and player feedback; Data analysts use data to implement machine learning for specific purposes, whilst AI developers using data as inference for their AI algorithms. 
            The biggest distinction between the above jobs is their purpose, AI devs and Data analyst may share a common goal in working with machine learning, but Game devs are creating a product for entertainment/consumption. 
            The nature of game development also requires a lot more communication and team-work (Many different positions ranging from Level Design, Networking, Programmer, Modelling, etc.) than you would as a Data Analyst or AI Developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our career plans all share a common path - finish our bachelors and attain as many useful/relevant skills for the duration of our studies as possible. 
            And hopefully amass enough experience and create an expansive portfolio, enough to qualify for our Ideal Jobs.
