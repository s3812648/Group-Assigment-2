                <h1>Job titles:</h1>
            </li>
            <p>
                All three of us have different ideal jobs for the future. 
                The first member named Khoi wants to become a Data Analyst. 
                The next member is Huy who seek to become a Game Designer. 
                Finally, Dung who wants to become an AI Engineer after graduating from RMIT. 
                Unfortunately, none of the Job titles above are represented in the Burning Glass data, therefore the demand for these jobs can only be based on conjecture with market analysis.

                <h1>Required skills:</h1>

                    IT-specific skills:

            </dl>
        <p>
            SQL has been in the top 3 of IT skills that are highest in demand. 
            More specifically, the Burning Glass Data shows that it is highest in demand. 
            C# and Linux share the same spot for demand, with the former slightly ahead of the latter. 
            Software Engineering is also present, and somewhat less in demand than the former 2 programming languages. 
            The last spot goes to Python, taking 15th place in 2017. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving onto general skills: 
            Overall, in any given field, and especially in the workplace, communication skills are always essential to connecting with colleges, 
            customers or bosses and also in IT work good communication will deliver useful information to the audience in order to generate a quality meeting or discussion about project and make it more convincing. 
            Then, the second most important skill in the 2017, 2018 list and also for us is problem-solving skills, 
            we all know that going to work is not easy because there are many problems that the employees need to solve and with ability to handle those problems well, 
            the worker not only receive rewards from companies, but also gain useful experience. 
            Furthermore, there are many required skills included in the list such as teamwork, creativity, research, multi-tasking, and English. Although, three of us have different future expected careers but all of them will definitely need those listed skills above to be fitted at workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were three highest ranking IT skills that are not required in our skill sets. 
            The first skill can be considered that is NET programming because currently we are focusing on Python which is fit and suitable for our expected future careers, 
            then we may learn about JAVA and SQL which are also popular and useful for us in the future. 
            And I believe that there will a good position for us if we have mastered any programming language. 
            Then we will talk about jQuery which is a library from JavaScript to simplify HTML DOM and none of us will become web design or relevant to website aspect in the future, 
            so jQuery may no a essential part for us. 
            Finally, another language related to HTML that is Cascading Style Sheets used to design presentation and content such as colors, fonts and layouts. 
            It is the cornerstone of World Wide Web, HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were three highest ranking general skills that are not required in our skill sets. 
            Writing can be important at some careers, but in IT field I think that our assignment, 
            our work will be submitted mainly programming projects which do not require a lot of writing there. 
            Next is presentation skill which sounds very useful in workplace but I think in a IT workplace the main focus will be on IT skill problem solving and algorithms, 
            presentation will be a task for other apartments in a company such as marketing or project development. 
            Finally, self-starter is a good characteristic but we will be working as a team or group if we want to success in the major and self-starter is more suited for people who are interested in business and startup. 
            Overall, the three skills above are not entirely unnecessary in the future workplace, the more skill we get the better job position we will acquire in the future.

            <h1>Closing thoughts after Burning Glass:</h1>
            <p>
            After looking and finding job demand through data from Burning Glass website, Dung and Khoi ideal jobs which relate to data, AI and software are in the lists of wanted IT jobs in 2017 and 2018 and we all know that AI and Machine learning are very hot recently and being developed in many field around the world. 
            There is no reason we give up on believing and chasing such a promising aspect in the future because of high job demand and high salary as we can see in many advertisement posts from previous assignment. 
            And about Huy and his future career game designer is not a very demanded job but it is always needed because people need to entertain and video games are an effective way to do and connect people with the market is now expanding and reaching to more types of age. 
            Nowadays, video game is stepping on a revolution that helps human have more realistic experience such as VR and graphic HoloLens. 
            One more reason that Huy is not giving up on game design that is his passion on when he was a little boy, he has tried and had experience on designing games through many 2D flatform, especially Game Marker 8. 
            Finally, we believe that we are studying for ourselves and our satisfaction, we cannot work and do what we dislike for a long time, so it is better we love it.
