        <h2>What happens in a day's work in IT?</h2>
        <p>
            Even as most, if not, all of us have a vague notion of what we'd like to do or head towards in IT, 
            Our field is one of constant change - code gets updated, vulnerabilities fixed, methods and documentation in constant flux. 
            So to determine what goes on in a day's work in the IT industry, we found the chance to interview Nguyen Khac Duy Khanh, 
            an Android Developer at SICLO. 
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Khanh is 29 years old and has workd in IT for 6 years. He started as a tester for Officience and stayed here for 2 years until he moved to SICLO. 
            His job is to facilitate communication between management and his team and he is also a QA tester for the project.

        <ol>
            <li>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</li>
            <p>
                "About 6 years ago when I graduated Electronics & Telecommunications degree from Ho Chi Minh University of Science in Vietnam, 
                I had worked as a tester at Officience for almost 2 years, then I moved to SICLO â€“ a French outsourcing company and I have been working for 4 years up to date as an Android Developer."
            </p>
            <li>Can you give us some insight into what a day's work entails?</li>
            <p> 
                "Sure, we have meetings everyday to talk about our progress and difficulties that some members might be having. 
                And for new projects, I'll usually be the one architecting and planning, but since we're using agile the planning is more like outlining features to work on (based on customer demands or management). 
                And again, since we use Agile, no one has a set role, anyone can work on anything thats been outlined, so I also do QA, debugging, whatevers needed to be done."
            </p>
            <li>And what other kinds of work do you have to do?</li>
            <p>
                "What I just talked about pretty much sums it up"
            </p>
            <li>Right, so who do you usually interact with?</li>
            <p>
                "I have to interact with both foreigners and Vietnamese people daily. 
                My manager and one of my colleges are from France but they can speak English fluently, 
                so we can easily communicate, then there are two other Vietnamese members in my team. 
                Most of our customers are Vietnamese, but I dont usually interact with them."
            </p>
            <li>So you only really interact with your colleagues and other IT professionals?</li>
            <p>
                "Yes and no, I usually interact with my boss and management, and documents from customers about their demands, see if there are any confusions and what not. 
                I get tasks and updates from management and relay that to the team, sort of like a liason."
            </p>
            <li>So you never talk or interact with clients or investors?</li>
            <p>
                "Not really, its not my job. Thats usually handled by people up top and another team."
            </p>
            <li>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</li>
            <p>
                "Properly giving ETAs (Estimated Time Allocation). 
                This usually requires a ton of experience. 
                I remember one time when I got a project written by Hybrid not Android and the first step was estimating deadline time. 
                Then I checked the customer document and found it was missing some parts, so I told my boss but he really wanted this project. 
                So I had to make a decision and gave a 2-month ETA. 
                We had a lot of bumps working on this project, there was a feature the customer wanted. 
                The project is a job finding app, and they wanted to have a chat box, but they didnt specify this in the document beforehand. 
                So after missing a couple deadlines, they told us to stop the project. 
                It was bad for us financially and reputation-wise. 
                After that happened, I felt like it was on me, I made the decision to give the go-ahead and gave the customer an ETA.
                So I gave an apology to everyone and promised to only take projects I was sure we could handle and also talked to my boss about how important documentation is. "
            </p>
            <li>And what can you share as an example of the work you do that best captures the essenve of the IT industry?</li>
            <p>
                "I think a lot of people choose this profession because of money, only some do it for passion and I can say that I'm doing it for both. 
                It feels gratifying to see people use your product for whatever reason they're using it for. 
                Some colleagues I know only care about the logic and how the code runs, but I think its important to understand how an application runs and what customers think of them. 
                The high pay can be a convincing reason for this job I guess, there's always extremely high demand for any segment of IT. "
